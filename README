Text-Editor-Easy

Version 0.34.
Pure perl editor module and program. 10 demos in the program,
but still not usable.

Here are the features of the current editor module :
    - syntax highlighting but without context (each line is considered alone)
    - multi-thread by simple method calls
    - graphic user interface not tightly linked to the module (adaptation to console planned)
    - not sensitive to the size of the edited file

The editor program, 'Editor.pl', that uses the module adds the following features :
    - macro langage : perl
    - dynamic placement in the code that displays messages or warnings during execution
    - start of perl programs currently edited from the editor
    - session management

What is planned for version 1.0, perhaps for the end of 2008 :
    - annulation
    - slides management (vertical and horizontal)
    - context management in syntax highlighting
    - ...still a lot of bugs to fix, but a lot of them will remain.

Vital problems to solve in future versions :
    - memory leaks
    - object inheritance



INSTALLATION

I hope that this module can be installed with the standard cpan command.

Anyway, it contains pure perl modules and programs.
So it shouldn't be hard to install it manually and run the demos.

It's compatible with Windows and UNIX. I use perl 5.8.8 on Windows
and perl 5.8.7 on Linux.

In order to install it manually to execute the demos,
save the archive file on your computer (tar.gz file).
Uncompress, untar...

Now install the following modules from where you should, according to
your system (you shoud already have most of them) :
        - Tk
        - Syntax::Highlight::Perl
        - Data::Dump
        - Time::HiRes
        - IO::File
        - File::Basename
        - Scalar::Util
        - Devel::Size
        - SDBM_File
        - Fcntl
        - File::Copy
        - File::Spec

Once finished, execute the "Editor.pl" program in the root directory.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

There is neither support, nor documentation because it's moving fast.

Here are a few screen shots of what you should get when running the demos :
