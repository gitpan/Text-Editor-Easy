Text-Editor-Easy

Version 0.40.
Pure perl editor module and program. 10 demos in the program,
but still not usable.


INSTALLATION

I hope that this module can be installed with the standard cpan command.

Anyway, it contains pure perl modules and programs.
So it shouldn't be hard to install it manually and run the demos.

It's compatible with Windows and UNIX. I use perl 5.8.8 on Windows
and perl 5.8.7 on Linux.

In order to install it manually to execute the demos,
save the archive file on your computer (tar.gz file).
Uncompress, untar...

Now install the following modules from where you should, according to
your system (you shoud already have most of them) :
        - Tk
        - Syntax::Highlight::Perl
        - Data::Dump
        - Time::HiRes
        - IO::File
        - File::Basename
        - Scalar::Util
        - Devel::Size
        - SDBM_File
        - Fcntl
        - File::Copy
        - File::Spec

Once finished, execute the "Editor.pl" program in the root directory.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

There is neither support, nor documentation because it's moving fast.

Here are a few screen shots of what you should get when running the demos :
